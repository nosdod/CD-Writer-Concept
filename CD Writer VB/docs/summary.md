It now looks as though VBScript is actually a good choice for the CD Writer component.
The main examples from Microsoft on how to use the IMAPI2 interface are mostly in VBScript for a start.
Also the events generated by the IMAPI2 interface to give progress information for example are COM events - these don't appear to be well supported in PowerShell.

So I will now start to produce some examples proof of concept apps in VBScript, based on the start made in the Powershell directory.
